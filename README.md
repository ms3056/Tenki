# Manually installing the plugin

- Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/Tenki/`.

# Usage
- Head over to weatherapi.com (you can link to it from the settings) and get your free api key and paste it into the settings
- Enter your city, and you should see the weather update
- If the app is not visible then from the command menu (control+p on Windows) type tenki and enter `Tenki: Open`
- The weather feed doesn't update more than about every 30 minutes - setting the refresh value lower than this not be useful
- All of the weather display elements have CSS classes - take a look at styles.css and feel free to create your own snippets to hide or style the elements how you like
